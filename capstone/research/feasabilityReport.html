    <h1>Coding Components & Feasability Report</h1>

    <section>
        <p>Features I Plan to Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click and drag companies, parks, museums, stores, and other buildings and infrastructure onto a grid type layout</li>
                <li>“i” icon under each to help users understand what they are and what they do</li>
                <li>“About This Project” with information about the project and why it was created</li>
                <li>A box on the side showing how walkable a city that the user created is</li>
                <li>A display box on the bottom showing what users have placed</li>
                <li>Rotating gradient background in the back</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Some libraries I have been looking into for this project include <a href="https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/">Typed.js, </a><a href="https://shopify.github.io/draggable/">Draggable JS, </a><a href="https://interactjs.io/">Interact.js, </a>and <a href="https://sarcadass.github.io/granim.js/">Granim.js.</a></p>
        <p>For these libraries, the only library I have worked with already is Granim.js, so I have to get familiar with the other three libraries. In order to do so, I think I will work on making mini files for all of them and try to do something with them to see if it works properly. With that, I will decide if I like using interact.js or Draggable js more, seeing if only one is enough to get my project to work.</p>
