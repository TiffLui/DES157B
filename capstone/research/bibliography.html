        <h3>“Investigating people’s preferences for car-free city centers: A discrete choice experiment.”</h3>
        <p>Gundlach, Amely, et al. “Investigating people’s preferences for car-free city centers: A discrete choice experiment.” Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, vol. 63, 2018, pp. 677-688. ScienceDirect, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2018.07.004">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2018.07.004</a>.</p>
        <p>The article, "Investigating people's preferences for car-free city centers: A discrete choice experiment" goes over the results and methods of the authors of the article. Surveying the people of Berlin, Germany, they realized that around 60% of the people chose a car-free city center. The results of the survey indicated that 90% of the people would choose a car-free city center once the bike infrastructure is improved and public transportation fees are reduced. It is mentioned in the article that "balancing the need for mobility with environmental and health concerns" is one of the most pressing problems for the sustainability of urban centers. So in recent years, policymakers and decision-makers have been paying more attention to this issue in Europe. The survey has lots of other detailed information that is helpful for my project. And it’s a good starting point to see what other countries are doing in terms of the issue. </p>>

        <h3>“Car free cities: Pathway to healthy urban living.”</h3>
        <p>Khreis, Haneen, and Mark J. Nieuwenhuijsen. “Car free cities: Pathway to healthy urban living.” Environment International, vol. 94, 2016, pp. 251-262. ScienceDirect, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2016.05.032">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2016.05.032</a>.</p>
        <p>The authors of the article, "Car free cities: Pathway to healthy urban living," Mark J. Nieuwenhuijsen and Haneen Khreis, go over cities that have decided to become partially car-free. While also going over what this could mean for greenhouse emissions, air pollution, temperature, and public health. The authors acknowledge how cars are such an important part of our transportation system and what they have given us in terms of convenience and mobility, but at the same target, they also point out how it is a good idea to shift towards more environmentally friendly mobility means. They also bring out research and evidence from other authors about how much space private cars take up. This factual evidence from other authors and this article's authors brings a lot of knowledge needed for my project. </p>

        <h3>“New urban models for more sustainable, liveable and healthier cities post covid19; reducing air pollution, noise and heat island effects and increasing green space and physical activity.”</h3>
        <p>Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J. “New urban models for more sustainable, liveable and healthier cities post covid19; reducing air pollution, noise and heat island effects and increasing green space and physical activity.” Environment International, vol. 157, 2021. ScienceDirect, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106850">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106850</a>.</p>
        <p>Mark J. Nieuwenhuijsen’s article, “New urban models for more sustainable, liveable and healthier cities post covid19; reducing air pollution, noise and heat island effects and increasing green space and physical activity” describes a number of examples on new urban models that reduce air pollution and noise, while increasing green space and physical activity levels. And how COVID-19 has helped accelerate these new urban models. Some of the models and concepts he goes over include the Superblocks, 15 Minute City, and car-free cities. This article is helpful for my project because it goes over the topics that my project would cover, since I am focusing on car-free cities and more “green” cities. This gives me a lot of information for my project. </p>
