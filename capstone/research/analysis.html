        <h3>Defeat BOCO</h3>

        <p><a href="https://www.defeatboco.com/worlds">Defeat BOCO</a> is an interactive site that shows users the value of UX design. The site takes users through four different “worlds” or stages, giving users the knowledge they need before finally “defeating” B.O.C.O. The site uses infinite scrolling to display the information slowly. But by scrolling down the page, the page moves horizontally visually, which encourages the feeling of adventuring or a story. What I really like about it is how easy it is to get lost in the visuals, and how easy it is to understand what is happening. It’s just a really fascinating site. </p>

        <p><a href="https://shopify.github.io/draggable/">Draggable JS</a> is the main site of a library for Javascript, where it shows users what it can do, consisting of drag and drop, colliding objects, and animation. The site is really colorful and easy to navigate around. It’s also really fun to interact with the many objects that they have on the site, just to see how they interact with each other. It helps push their product when it displays all they have. The sound effects they have also make it a lot more interesting for users.</p>
