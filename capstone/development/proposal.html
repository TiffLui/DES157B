    <title>Captstone Project Proposal</title>

    <h1>Capstone Projct Proposal</h1>
    <article>
        <p>	My topic I have chosen for the capstone project is exploring cities like Culdesac, where everything within the city is bikeable or walkable with or without public transportation. And why these cities are realistic and something we could consider going towards in the future. The target audience I have considered are the general public and urban city planners and architects. For this project, I don’t have any plans to work with a partner. For the project, I’m focusing more on challenging mental models of single use zoning in cities, the linear growth paradigm, and the mentality that cities should be designed for cars first then people. I want to bring some data visualization into it as well, to make the project more interesting and fun. Since some of the features I have in mind right now are either following the narrative of a persona, going about their day in a city like Culdesac or a game of building a little city online, kind of like The Sims. But they would also get rated on how to make it more green or what could be better to make a city more easy to roam around. I’m still debating between the two, as I’m a bit curious on how I would be able to make something like that, but we’ll see! </p>
